## What is Pokemon Go?

You caved. You're finally ready to find out what Pokemon Go is all about.

Pokemon Go is an [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) (AR) [geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching) mobile game where you'll search for virtual caches of Pokemon with which to raise and battle.

Make sense? Okay, let's try a little simpler. Pokemon Go is a game where you walk around outside to find and capture Pokemon near you. As you [level up](#level-up-your-trainer) in the game, you can [make your Pokemon stronger](#raise-your-pokemon-s-cp), [battle other Pokemon](#battle-other-pokemon), take control of [Pokemon Gyms](#pokemon-gyms), and much more.

As a new Pokemon Go Trainer, you'll take to the streets, parks, and tall grass to catch 'em all and be The Very Best Like No One Ever Was.

Sound fun? Let's get started!
