## Advanced Gameplay

### Hatch an Egg

Ready to walk? You better be, because there's no other way to hatch Pokemon eggs.

Eggs can only be received from [Pokestops](#pokestops), and you can only hold nine eggs at a time. They are not that rare, but you'll only receive new ones once you have an open spot for one out of your nine spots. Meaning, you have to hatch eggs to receive more eggs.

Eggs come in three varieties: 2km, 5km, and 10km. As you can guess, these are the walking distances required to hatch that particular egg. To begin counting your steps toward that number however, you'll need to put an egg into an Incubator.

**Incubators** are pretty hard to come by. You'll receive one special orange Incubator at the start of the game that can be used an infinite number of times, and you'll also receive another one early on with limited usage. All Incubators besides the special orange one have limited usage, and will break after 3 uses. The easiest way to get more Incubators is to buy them in the Store for 150 coins (~$1.50).

*Note: To see which Pokemon are hatched by which eggs, [see this list](http://i.imgur.com/9HdbtXA.jpg).*

Another note about hatching eggs is that your distance is tracked by GPS, not your phone's pedometer. It will only calculate distance traveled by your Trainer while Pokemon Go is open, and will stop tracking distance if you're moving too fast. This means driving around with the app open is just as useless as wearing your phone while on a treadmill.

With all this information in mind, hatching eggs is pretty straightforward. That being said, you may consider some strategies as well. Using your infinite Incubator on your smaller distance eggs (especially 2km) will get you more uses out of your Incubators. Another strategy is to wait and load up some eggs all at the same time, so they will hatch at the same time. Then, wait to plan a [Lucky Egg session](#level-up-your-trainer) until they are all about to hatch for a sweet XP boost.

### Level Up Your Trainer

There is only one way to level up your Trainer, and that's by gaining XP. Luckily, most things you do in the game will get you XP.

The **easiest ways to get XP** are probably as follows:

| Action | XP |
| :-- | --: |
| [Spinning a Pokestop](#pokestops) | 50 XP |
| [Catching a Pokemon](#catch-pokemon) | 100 XP |
| [Evolving a Pokemon](#raise-your-pokemon-s-cp) | 500 XP |

In addition to these, you can also gain XP in a myriad of ways, such as:

| Action | XP |
| :-- | --: |
| Nice throw | 10&nbsp;XP |
| Great throw | 50&nbsp;XP |
| Excellent throw | 100&nbsp;XP |
| Curveball throw | 10&nbsp;XP |
| Catch an unregistered Pokemon | 500&nbsp;XP |
| Hatch 2km egg | 200&nbsp;XP |
| Hatch 5km egg | 500&nbsp;XP |
| Hatch 10km egg | 1000&nbsp;XP |
| Gym Battle/Train | Varies |

Beyond the aforementioned, items called **Lucky Eggs** can also be utilized. Contrary to their name, these items do not hatch anything, but instead will double *any* experience earned for the next 30 minutes after used. They're pretty rare to receive in-game, but can be bought at the Store for 80 coins (~$0.80).

If you're looking for the **most effective way to earn XP quickly**, Lucky Eggs will be your best bet. Save up several low-cost evolution Pokemon like Pidgeys (12), Weedles (12), and Caterpies (12), or even Rattatas (25), Eevees (25), and Zubats (50) if you just have too many. Then, use a Lucky Egg and evolve as many as you can for the next 30 minutes. Pokemon evolutions give 500 XP, so 1000 XP each with the Lucky Egg.

*Note: This XP strategy will only work after you've spent some time in the game. You'll need to have a lot of candy for any particular Pokemon to evolve many of them. If you're trying to plan out a maximum XP session, feel free to use the [Pidgey Calculator](http://pidgeycalc.com) created by Reddit user u/bchn.*

### Raise your Pokemon's CP

Every Pokemon has a Combat Power (CP) level. The only way to "level" your Pokemon is to raise its CP level.

The higher your Trainer's level, the higher level CP wild Pokemon will have. Also, your Trainer's level will determine the CP cap of your captured Pokemon. This cap can be observed by the white arc above the Pokemon in your Pokemon list. A Pokemon's CP cannot be raised past its cap.

![Pokemon have a maximum level CP based on their Trainer's level](/assets/pokemon-cp-cap.png)

To raise your Pokemon's CP, select it from the list and tap "Power Up". Each power up will require a certain amount of **Stardust**, as well as candy. Candy is specific to each Pokemon evolution ladder, but Stardust is shared between all of a Trainer's Pokemonâ€”so be careful how you use it. As your Pokemon levels up, it will begin to cost more Stardust and more candy per power up.

The following is a comprehensive list of how much CP different fully-evolved Pokemon will gain per power up (work-in-progress, compiled by Reddit user u/zehipp0):

| Pokemon | CP |

| Mewtwo* | 57 |
| Dragonite, Mew* | 50 |
| Snorlax | 45 |
| Moltres* | 44 |
| Lapras, Zapdos* | 43 |

### Win Gym Battles

You've leveled up your Trainer, you've powered up your Pokemon, but you just can't seem to win Pokemon Gym battles? Don't worry, once you learn the right strategies, you'll be able to hang with the best of them.

Most newbies go into Pokemon battles with one strategy: Brute Force. Tapping the screen as fast as possible, you try to overwhelm the enemy with your impressive CP and hope your opponent runs out of health before you. For the most part, if you're a high enough level, this might work. However, there is a bit more nuance as well.

There are two major points to consider in Pokemon battles: Pokemon type strength/weaknesses, and timing attacks/dodges.

**Pokemon types** are probably the most important factors to consider when entering a battle. This may seem like a no-brainer to Pokemon veterans, but this may be news to rookie Trainers. Every Pokemon has a type (or two), and every attack has a type. The type of *attack* used on a defending Pokemon can alter the damage done:

* Super effective attack does 1.25x damage
* Not very effective attack does 0.8x damage

*Note: The type of the __attack__ is the one to be considered against the defending Pokemon's type.*

In addition to this, there is a **Same-Type Attack Bonus** (STAB) in Pokemon Go. This is when a Pokemon uses an attack that has a matching type to one of its own types, e.g. the GRASS-type Bulbasaur using the GRASS-type attack Vine Whip. The STAB in Pokemon Go is 1.25x damage.

Also note that the above is different than any other Pokemon game previous. Super effective has been reduced to 1.25x, Not very effective has been upped to only 0.8x, and No effect has been removed entirely (replaced by Not very effective). The STAB has also been reduced in this game to only 1.25x damage boost.

So grab yourself [a handy Pokemon type chart](https://i.redd.it/oy7lrixl8r9x.png), and study up. Most charts (including this one) show the attack type on the left axis and the defending Pokemon's type on the top axis. If you'd like to find or make your own chart, just know that the types match up with Generation&nbsp;VI, and remember the multiplier changes outlined above.

**Battle Timing** is also important to master if you want to win lots of battles without losing lots of HP. To successfully dodge an opponent's attack, look for the yellow flash at the bottom of the screen and quickly swipe left or right. The flash will always come right before the attack, so always wait for the flash before swiping to dodge.

Once you've dodged, try to attack once or twice, depending on how fast your Pokemon can attack. Then wait for the yellow flash again to dodge the enemy's next attack.

Repeat this process for the duration of the battle, and you should easily take down Pokemon of considerably higher levels without losing much health. Combine this with solid type advantages, and you'll be taking over Pokemon Gyms like it was your destiny.
