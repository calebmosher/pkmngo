## Pokemon Gyms

### Choose a Team

Once you [level up your Trainer](#level-up-your-trainer) to level 5, you have the option to choose a team. Select any gym (doesn't even have to be close to you) to be prompted to make your selection. Which team you choose has no bearing on how you play the game other than how you interact with gyms. You have three choices:

* Team Instinct (yellow)
* Team Mystic (blue)
* Team Valor (red)

**Team Instinct** is lead by Spark, their color is yellow, and their legendary mascot is Zapdos. Spark believes that Pokemon have innate talents, and that success in battle is best achieved by trusting your—yep, you got it—instincts. As of now, team Instinct has the fewest members.

**Team Mystic** is lead by Blanche, their color is blue, and their legendary mascot is Articuno. Blanche believes in reason and intellect over blind faith, and that success in battle is best achieved by using your wisdom. As of now, team Mystic is clearly the most popular as it has the most members of the three.

**Team Valor** is lead by Candela, their color is red, and their legendary mascot is Moltres. Candela believes power is what is most important in the world, and that success in battle is best achieved by overcoming your opponent with passion and strength.

Now that you've chosen a team, you have access to any Pokemon Gym nearby. At Gyms controlled by your team, you can battle your teammates stationed Pokemon to raise that Gym's prestige points and earn XP. At rival-controlled Gyms, you can battle opponent team's Pokemon to lower their Gym prestige and try to take over the Gym itself.

### Battle Other Pokemon

You've declared a team, and you're ready to battle—here's how.

Every Pokemon has three moves: a standard attack, special attack, and dodge. You can see any Pokemon's attacks in your Pokemon list.

To use your **standard attack** in battle, simply tap the screen. That's it. You can use your standard attack as fast as the game will allow, and as many times as you want.

To use your **special attack**, you'll have to wait until one of the blue special bars is filled up, then press and hold to unleash it. To build the special meter, use standard attacks. Different special moves will have different size special bars to build, so pay attention to how much special you've built up, or you may be wasting your time trying to unleash a special move that you can't use yet.

To **dodge**, swipe either left or right. Your Pokemon will move in an outer circle around the opposing Pokemon. But be careful, as after you dodge, the other Pokemon will turn to face you again.

As a Trainer, you can also swap out your current Pokemon for another in your battle party at any time using the button in the lower-left corner. This is useful if you are planning to utilize [type advantages](#win-gym-battles) to win battles easier.

### Control a Gym

Depending on what team controls it, you will interact with a nearby Pokemon Gym in one of two ways.

At **Rival Gyms**, you will go into battle with six of your best Pokemon and face off against all of the rival Pokemon stationed there in a row. Starting with the lowest-powered and ending with the highest-powered, fight your way to the top to decrease that Gym's prestige points and earn XP. Once you've brought their prestige to zero, you'll have the option to station one of your own Pokemon there and claim the Gym for yourself.

At **Team Gyms**, you will take only one of your Pokemon into battle against all of your Team's friendly Pokemon stationed there in a row. By beating them, you will earn XP, as well as raise the prestige of that Gym for your team. Note that when you lose to your team's stationed Pokemon, your own Pokemon will be left with 1 HP instead of fainted (saving you some Revives).

As the prestige of a Gym is raised, the Gym level will go up. Higher level Gyms will be able to have more Pokemon defenders, as a Gym's numeric level corresponds directly with how many Pokemon can be stationed there. To best control a Gym, station your most powerful Pokemon there to resist challenges from rival teams.

Stationing a Pokemon at a Gym gives you, yes, awesome bragging rights. But it also gives you a **Defender Bonus** of 10 coins and 500 [Stardust](#raise-your-pokemon-s-cp) per stationed defender per 24-hour period. To redeem your reward, go to the Store while you have Pokemon stationed in a gym and tap the shield icon at the top right.
