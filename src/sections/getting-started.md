## Getting Started

### Signing Up

To sign up for Pokemon Go, you have two options:

* Google Login
* Pokemon Club Login

The Google login should be the easiest way, but if you're on iOS and [aren't comfortable with the app permissions](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/pokemon-go-on-ios-gets-full-access-to-your-google-account/) involved—you can always [create a free Pokemon Club account]().

### Choose Your Trainer

Next, get yourself ready to be The Very Best by choosing a unique trainer name and selecting a cool trainer outfit from a (very limited) set of choices.

See the [Choose a Team](#choose-a-team) section to find out!

### Choose Your Starter

Now that your trainer is adventure-ready, it's time to choose a starter Pokemon. As of now, there are three standard choices available and one secret choice. If you're a seasoned Pokemon Trainer, you'll know them as the original four from the Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow series:

* Charmander
* Squirtle
* Bulbasaur
* Pikachu (secret)

To get one of the first three, after you're done talking to Professor Willow, you'll see three Pokemon standing near you on the map. Tap the one you want and your first Pokemon encounter will start.

To get Pikachu, ignore the first three Pokemon you see and walk away. After not selecting one for long enough, eventually Pokemon Go will get the hint and show you a Pikachu!

### Settings

Now that you're all set, it may be a good time to check the settings on your app. Here you can manage your sound preferences, as well as turn on an interesting feature called Battery Saver.

**Battery Saver** will turn the app dark gray and lock the screen when you turn your phone upside-down. This is helpful if you'd like to leave Pokemon Go running in your pocket with the screen on. If you're going to be out for a while though, you may want to bring an external battery pack as Pokemon Go will make your phone battery self-destruct faster than a Voltorb.
