## How to Play Basics

### Pokestops

As you travel, you'll see blue cubes floating in the air; these are Pokestops. When you get close to one, it will open up, and you'll be able to interact with it. Tap any Pokestop to see its information.

If you are close enough to one that it is open when you tap it, you'll be able to spin it and receive some items. Tap or swipe all the items that come out to receive them, or just exit the Pokestop and you will receive them all anyway.

If you'd like to put a **Lure Module** at a nearby Pokestop that doesn't already have one, tap the white pill-looking area above the spinner to place one there. However, if the Pokestop is too far away, you won't be able to do so.

Interacting with Pokestops is the easiest way to replenish your items, so be sure to visit them often. Also note that **you'll receive 50 XP for every Pokestop you successfully spin**, so it helps in leveling up as well. Pokestops reset after 5 minutes, after which you can spin them again for more items.

### Find Pokemon

Pokeballs in hand, you're finally ready to catch 'em all—but where are they?

First you should notice that your Trainer has a radar-like circle emanating from his or her feet. This is your detection zone, and is what gives you a bit of extra reach to interact with [Pokestops](#pokestops) and to [catch Pokemon](#catch-pokemon). Your detection zone reaches out to about 45 meters.

Now, look at the bottom-right of your screen, where you'll see the "Nearby" indicator. This will show you which Pokemon are closest to you. The paw prints under each are approximate distances:

* **3 prints** means a Pokemon is **90 meters** away or more
* **2 prints** means a Pokemon is **50 meters** away or more
* **1 print** means a Pokemon is **45 meters** away or more
* **0 prints** means a Pokemon **should appear on-screen**, as it is within your Trainer's radar detection zone.

This means that if a Pokemon is only one print away, it should be no more than maybe 5–10 meters from your current location. Nearby Pokemon are ordered from the closest to the farthest away, where the top left is the closest. So if you're tracking a distant Pokemon, try to watch as it either climbs up or down the list. To track a single Pokemon's prints, tap it and your small indicator will only show that Pokemon and how far away it is.

*Note: When the Nearby indicator is small, it will actually be in reverse order. The Pokemon closest to you will be on the right, not left.*

**Lure Modules** and **Incense** can also be used to attract Pokemon. Lure modules are used at [Pokestops](#pokestops) to attract Pokemon for all trainers to that area. Incense is used to attract Pokemon to the area around only the Trainer that uses it. With Incense, Pokemon will appear once about every 5 minutes if standing still, or can appear as quickly as once every minute if the Trainer has moved 200 meters since the last encounter.

### Catch Pokemon

You've tracked down that Pidgey, and now you're ready to catch it. Once a Pokemon appears on-screen, tap it to initiate a Pokemon encounter.

This is pretty straightforward, but there are some tricks to know on how to catch a Pokemon. The basics are to grab the Pokeball at the bottom of your screen and swipe up to throw it at the Pokemon. You want the Pokeball to land inside the white ring around the Pokemon to get it inside the ball.

There is also a **colored inner ring** that changes in size. Its color can range from bright green to dark orange. The more green the color, the easier the Pokemon is to catch. The more orange the color, the harder the encounter will be. To increase your chances of capture, you can do three things:

* Try to have your throw land when the inner ring is at its smallest
* Feed the Pokemon berries (such as Razz Berry)
* Use a better Pokeball (such as Great Ball)

Also, if you get the Pokeball to land inside the smaller circle itself, you'll get an extra boost in XP if you capture that Pokemon from that throw. These are the possibilities:

* "Nice!" (circle is approx. 66% or bigger) will earn you 10 XP
* "Great!" (circle is approx. 33% – 66%) will earn you 50 XP
* "Excellent!" (circle is approx. 33% or smaller) will earn you 100 XP

*Note: These messages do not help your chances of catching the Pokemon, only give you more XP if/when you do catch it.*

You can also grab the Pokeball and drag it around in a spinning motion before throwing it. Throwing this "Curve Ball" and capturing a Pokemon with it will earn you a cool 10 XP.
